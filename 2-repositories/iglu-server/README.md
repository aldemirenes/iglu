# Iglu Server

Iglu Server is a RESTful schema registry, allowing users to publish, test and serve schemas via an easy-to-use RESTful interface.

## Quickstart guide

Assuming [SBT][sbt] is installed and a PostgreSQL database is set up, use the one-time `setup` subcommand to set up PostgreSQL entities that will be used by the Iglu Server:

```bash
$ sbt "run setup --config application.conf"
```

To run the server itself, use:

```bash
$ sbt "run --config application.conf"
```

Alternatively, the server, along with a PostgreSQL instance, can be launched as Docker containers via Docker Compose:

```
$ cd docker
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Differences with 0.5.0

## Consistency

1. Impossible to add `1-0-1` if `1-0-0` does not exist
2. Impossible to add private schema if previous version was public (and vice versa)
3. Changes in authentication service. All should be backward-compatible, but now access can be much more fine-grained, e.g. "key that can only create schemas for certain vendor"
4. Impossible to add a schema desribed as `iglu:com.snplow/foo/jsonschema/1-0-0` in payload at the `com.acme/bar/jsonschema/1-0-0` endpoint. `POST /api/schemas` accepts only schemas with self-desribing payload, `PUT /api/schemas/vendor/name/format/version` accepts both plain and self-describing schemas, but in latter case always performs a check

## New features

1. `/api/debug` endpoint (when `debug = true` in configuration file) that returns the Iglu Server's internal state, if in-memory storage is used instead of PostgreSQL. This should be used for development only
2. `/api/meta` endpoint, including health check routes and a route that returns metadata about the Iglu Server (version, database type, schema count etc.)
3. `patchesAllowed` setting, prohibiting patches in production servers and allowing in Mini

## About to change

1. No more `metadata`/`body` query parameters `repr=canonical/meta/uri` should be used (they're supported but deprecated) instead for all entrypoints returning list of schemas
2. Deprecation of all form fields
3. Swagger is available on `http://$SERVER/static/swagger-ui/index.html`
4. For schema validation it is recommended to use `/api/validatation` endpoint (`/api/schemas/validate` is available, but deprecated)
